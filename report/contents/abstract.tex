\begin{abstract}

In classical savings theory it is stated that the optimal way to ensure a risk level is to set a constant proportion of risky assets at all time. Moreover, most savings strategies try to optimize their performance using simple and widely employed risk measures that are neither scale-free nor location-free.

Throughout this work we will replicate the results of an alternative optimal strategy that changes proportion invested in risky assets along time; we will incorporate the concept of Pooled Fund to those schemes and will study the risk profile of all those strategies using Tail Distribution Modelling and Extreme Value Analysis.
